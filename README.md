### Sources / Credit / Copyright

I'll update this with proper copyright information later, but for now, credit for essentially anything here that is not
code belongs to Scott Cawthon and respective corporations (ie. game concept, graphics, sound, etc)

Before playing this game, please support the original developers by buying the original game [here][3].

Any files not containing any code written by me should have a file called `.SOURCE.md` in the same directory as them.
That will have the source for the corresponding file and an explanation of which file(s) this applies to.

## Big thanks to the following sources! (some in advance):

* JetBrains ([CLion][6] is awesome)

* [How to use save-data][9]

### Other

Reminders: (for myself mostly)

* Once all images are working in the game, check if any should be brightened or compressed

GitHub todo: (things to do that really only affect the GitHub page)
