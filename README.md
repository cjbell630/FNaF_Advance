# Five Nights at Freddy's: Advance

### Note: This is a work in progress. I am using this project to learn about GBA development, so it will likely be very slow.

You can find the current demo in either [releases][1] (working demo) or [`/out/FNaF_Advance.gba`][2] (possibly non-working demo).

I'll update this with proper copyright information later, but for now, credit for essentially anything here that is not code belongs to Scott Cawthon and respective corporations (ie. game concept, graphics, sound, etc)

Before playing this game, please support the original developers by buying the original game [here][3].

Any files not containing any code written by me should have a file called `.SOURCE.md` in the same directory as them. That will have the source for the corresponding file and an explanation of which file(s) this applies to.

## Big thanks to the following sources! (Some in advance):
* [Scott Cawthon][4] / [Five Night's at Freddy's (PC)][3]
* J Vijn ([excellent and extrememly helful GBA tutorial][5]
* JetBrains ([CLion][6] is awesome)
* Tech Rules (This would've been immensely difficult without his [animatronic AI explanation][7])

GitHub todo: (things to do that really only affect the GitHub page)
* Copyright info in README
* Download instructions for people who don't know GitHub
