# Five Nights at Freddy's: Advance

### Note: This is a work in progress. I am using this project to learn about GBA development, so it will likely be very slow.

You can find the current demo in either releases (working demo) or [`/out/FNaF_Advance.gba`][1] (possibly non-working demo).

I'll update this with proper copyright information later, but for now, credit for essentially anything here that is not code belongs to Scott Cawthon and respective corporations (ie. game concept, graphics, sound, etc)

Before playing this game, please support the original developers by buying the original game [here][2].

Any files not containing any code written by me should have a file called `.SOURCE.md` in the same directory as them. That will have the source for the corresponding file and an explanation of which file(s) this applies to.


GitHub todo: (things to do that really only affect the GitHub page)
